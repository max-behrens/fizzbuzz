Hi, this application prints all numbers up to the number you have entered, whereby instead of printing out the number if it is divisible by 3, it will instead print out 'Fizz!'.
Likewise, if the number is divisible by 5, the number will be replaced by 'Buzz!', and 'Fizz Buzz!' if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.

In order to run this Fizz Buzz application, you will need to download the Github repository,
save the folder in your htdocs folder on your C drive, and the run the codebase locally in your browser.
